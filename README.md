# wizeline-challenge
As part of the requirements for be able to follow up the Golang Bootcamp
I have created this simple project for golangbootcamp@wizeline.com

Acceptance Criteria:
Support two endpoints
- An endpoint should display the typical "Hello, World"
- An endpoint is open to your consideration. You can consume an external DB or API, e.g. weather, location.
Add relevant unit testing following best practices from the selected language.
Deliverable:
- Source code files (.zip)/Git repo link
- README with instruction on how to run the project (language version, framework, or running dependencies if any).
